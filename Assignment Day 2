// Q1  program to search for a particular charachter in a string

let string = "string_to_be_searched"    // enter the string you want 
let index = string.indexOf("c")         // enter the charachter you want to search
document.write(index)                   // if we want the result in document
console.log(index)                      // if we want to see the result in console

NOTE:-  Here if we search for a charachter which is present in the string provided, 
it gives the index of that particular charachter as result 
but if that charachter is not present in given string the result comes as -1.
also if we leave the "" in the string.indexOf empty, the result is 0.
